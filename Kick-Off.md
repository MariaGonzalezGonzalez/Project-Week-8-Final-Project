## Project Description
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and the second most common cancer overall. It is a leading cause of cancer death in less developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women, exceeded only by lung cancer. There were over 2 million new cases in 2018 and the national incidence rate is around 138 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. As well, that the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is estimated to be approximately 1 in 8 women.

## Project Goals
Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

## Requirements
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory.
* You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned.
* Create a *.gitignore* file and include it in your repository. 
* You may be on team (3 people max) or work on your own.
* You can include ML or statistics, but it is not required to do so, as long as you have a rigorous analysis.
* You may use the data from your last project or from past projects.

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!). Respect deadlines.
* Ask for help vs Google is your friend.
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you ðŸ˜‰.
* Document yourself. Learn about the problem and what research has been done before you.
* Before making a graph, think what you want to represent.
* Don't force yourself to use tecniques if they are not helpful for your objective.
* If using machine learning, remember:
  * This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
    * Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
    * Try different hyperparameters and see if they improve the result.
